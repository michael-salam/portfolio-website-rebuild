            I'm someone who takes pride in contriuting to the growth of others,
            which is why I created a web developer community called BetterDev
          </p>
          <p>
            Through BetterDev, I am helping over three hundred web developers
            (and counting) across Nigeria connect, collaborate and learn from
            one another.
